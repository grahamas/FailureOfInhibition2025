# WCM1973 Validation Test Summary

This document provides a high-level summary of the validation tests created for the `wcm1973!` implementation based on Wilson & Cowan (1973).

## Test Suite Overview

A comprehensive test suite (`test/test_wcm1973_validation.jl`) was created with **10 validation tests** that verify the mathematical correctness of the Wilson-Cowan model implementation.

## Tests Identified

### 1. **Equation Structure Validation**
Verifies the core equation: `τ dA/dt = -α*A + β*(1-A)*f(S+C)`

### 2. **Decay Parameter (α) Tests**
Validates that decay rate increases with α

### 3. **Saturation Coefficient (β) Tests**
Validates that nonlinearity gain scales with β

### 4. **Time Constant (τ) Tests**
Validates that dynamics slow down with larger τ

### 5. **Activity Bounds Tests**
Validates the (1-A) saturation mechanism

### 6. **Steady State Tests**
Validates equilibrium conditions where dA/dt = 0

### 7. **Two-Population Interaction Tests**
Validates E-I coupling and connectivity matrix

### 8. **Spatial Dynamics Tests**
Validates multi-point spatial computation

### 9. **Nonlinearity Types Tests**
Validates different sigmoid variants

### 10. **Saturation Mechanism Tests**
Validates growth limitation near A = 1

## Test Results

✅ **All 565 tests pass** (including the 10 new validation tests)

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in:
- **`docs/wcm1973_validation_tests.md`**: Full explanation of each test, its purpose, and theoretical basis

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run validation tests only
julia --project=. test/test_wcm1973_validation.jl

# Run full test suite
julia --project=. test/runtests.jl
```

## Mathematical Basis

All tests are based on the mathematical theory presented in:

> Wilson, H. R., & Cowan, J. D. (1973). A mathematical theory of the functional dynamics of cortical and thalamic nervous tissue. *Kybernetik*, 13(2), 55-80.

## Test Coverage

The validation tests provide comprehensive coverage of:
- ✅ Core equation structure
- ✅ All model parameters (α, β, τ)
- ✅ Biological constraints (activity bounds)
- ✅ Steady states and equilibria
- ✅ Population interactions
- ✅ Spatial extent handling
- ✅ Nonlinearity variations
- ✅ Saturation mechanisms

## Future Extensions

Potential additional tests based on the 1973 paper:
- Stability analysis of steady states
- Bifurcation behavior
- Oscillatory solutions
- Hysteresis effects
- Wave propagation in spatial models

These would require more sophisticated numerical analysis and are candidates for future development.
